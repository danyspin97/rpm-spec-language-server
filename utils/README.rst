Space for utilities for extracting detailed documentation and other details for 
hints.

extract_docs.py
---------------

This file generates the contents of ``autocomplete_data.json`` from a copy of
``spec.md``, which is taken from `here
<https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/blob/master/docs/manual/spec.md>`

Run it in this directory to generate a new version fo
``autocomplete_data.json``. There is no guarantee that the layout of
``spec.md`` is stable so this script is very liable to change.

spec.md
-------
A local copy of the `source markdown for the specfile manual page
<https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/blob/master/docs/manual/spec.md>`
which is used to generate detailed help as LSP documentation entries.

triggers.md
----------- 
The specfile man page references `this additional manual page
<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/master/docs/manual/triggers.md>`
which we need for trigger details.

file_triggers.md
---------------- 
Another manual page from `here
<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/master/docs/manual/file_triggers.md>`
which covers the file triggers.

autosetup.md
------------ 
Documentation for the ``%autosetup`` and ``%autopatch`` scriptlets taken from
`this manual page
<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/master/docs/manual/autosetup.md>`.

autocomplete_data.json
---------------------
A simple array of tuples pairing keywords with their original documentation
entries as taken from ``spec.md``, generated by ``extract_docs.py``.
